# bubble-sort
Function to run bubble sorting algorithm on set of numbers.  

## finished
-Having trouble figuring out good way to take a set of integers as inputs, decided to instruct user to pass them separated by commas

## plan  

-take a set of numbers as an array  
-have a loop that runs times equal to the length of array  
-on each pass of the loop nest another loop that will iterate through the array for one less item each pass  
-check that the item to right is greater than current index and swap if not  

## progress  

-loops worked as expected, straightforward to write
